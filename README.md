## stratonÂ® soft PLC

Made for [netPI](https://www.netiot.com/netpi/), the Raspberry Pi 3B Architecture based industrial suited Open Edge Connectivity Ecosystem

### Debian with straton soft PLC runtime from group COPA-DATA

The image provided hereunder deploys a container with installed Debian and the soft PLC [straton](https://www.straton-plc.com/) for Raspberry PI (unlicensed).

Base of this image builds [debian](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/) with unlicensed straton [runtime for Raspberry PI](https://www.straton-plc.com/en/news/success-stories/raspberry/) T5 in the version 9.1 which runs 15 minutes until it turns into a demo mode.

To upgrade to a full featured version use the image's building script as a template, add your bought `K5License.ini` (MAC address bound) file from COPA-DATA to the runtime folder `/home/pi`, rebuild it in an own repository and then deploy it on netPI.

#### Container prerequisites

##### Port mapping

To allow the access to the runtime from the straton IDE tool suite the container TCP port `1100` needs to be exposed to the host.

##### Privileged mode

The straton runtime need access on system level. Only the enabled privileged mode option lifts the enforced container limitations to allow the runtime system level access.

#### Getting started

STEP 1. Open netPI's landing page under `https://<netpi's ip address>`.

STEP 2. Click the Docker tile to open the [Portainer.io](http://portainer.io/) Docker management user interface.

STEP 3. Enter the following parameters under **Containers > Add Container**

* **Image**: `hilschernetpi/netpi-straton-softplc`

* **Port mapping**: `Host "1100" -> Container "1100"` 

* **Restart policy"** : `always`

* **Runtime > Privileged mode** : `On`

STEP 4. Press the button **Actions > Start/Deploy container**

Pulling the image may take a while (5-10mins). Sometimes it takes so long that a time out is indicated. In this case repeat the **Actions > Start/Deploy container** action.

#### Accessing

The container starts the straton runtime automatically when started. It is immediately ready to receive commands through the straton IDE tool suite. You have 15 minutes time for evaluation until the runtime turns into demo mode. You have to restart the container to reset the timer.

Use the straton IDE and create a new project as usual. Select `T5 Runtime` as runtime and netpi's ip address as ip address. After the default project has been created establish a connection to the runtime on netPI using the menu item `Project/online` and continue to use straton IDE as usual.

#### Automated build

The project complies with the scripting based [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) method to build the image output file. Using this method is a precondition for an [automated](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) web based build process on DockerHub platform.

DockerHub web platform is x86 CPU based, but an ARM CPU coded output file is needed for Raspberry systems. This is why the Dockerfile includes the [balena](https://balena.io/blog/building-arm-containers-on-any-x86-machine-even-dockerhub/) steps.

#### License

View the license information for the software in the project. As with all Docker images, these likely also contain other software which may be under other licenses (such as Bash, etc from the base distribution, along with any direct or indirect dependencies of the primary software being contained).
As for any pre-built image usage, it is the image user's responsibility to ensure that any use of this image complies with any relevant licenses for all software contained within.
